In October 2020, the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54449321) police had wrongly cancelled records of serious crimes, in many cases without informing victims, analysis of official reports shows.

We examined the most recent [crime data integrity inspection reports](https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmicfrs/our-work/article/crime-data-integrity/reports-rolling-programme-crime-data-integrity/) from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire Rescue Services (HMICFRS), which detailed how officers incorrectly cancelled reports of rape, sexual offences, violence and robbery.

Charity Rape Crisis said the findings were "completely unacceptable".

The Home Office said forces received "clear guidance" on cancelling crimes.
